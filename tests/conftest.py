"""Shared pytest configuration for the Marstek Venus Energy Manager test suite.

The Home Assistant test harness comes from ``pytest-homeassistant-custom-component``.
Nothing here talks to real hardware.

Note: tests that use the full in-process ``hass`` fixture build a Home Assistant
event loop. On Windows that loop needs a local socketpair which ``pytest-socket``
(bundled with the HA plugin) blocks, so full integration-level tests are expected
to run in CI on Linux. The unit-level tests in this suite are deliberately written
without the ``hass`` fixture so they run everywhere, including a Windows dev box.

To opt a future test into loading the integration, request the
``enable_custom_integrations`` fixture provided by the plugin.

class FakeCoordinator:
    """Test double pinned to the real coordinator's public surface.

    Every key in ``_DEFAULTS`` mirrors a real ``MarstekVenusDataUpdateCoordinator``
    attribute or property (``is_available`` and ``device_key`` are properties
    there, the rest are instance attributes). The constructor rejects any keyword
    outside that set, so a test cannot invent ``available=`` to match a production
    typo — the real attribute is ``is_available``. That was the interface-drift
    hole: ``SimpleNamespace`` happily *wrote* the bogus name, so the later read
    succeeded and the test went green while production crashed.

    Reading an attribute that was never set raises ``AttributeError`` for free
    (ordinary class), so a production read of a wrong name fails the test too.
    This is intentionally *not* ``__slots__``: production attaches private runtime
    state onto the live coordinator (``_pd_write_count``, ``_hysteresis_active``,
    …) by assignment, and the fake must allow that exactly as the real object does.
